# Binary-search
A simple implementation of binary search in Java.
Binary search is used to search a key element from multiple elements. 
Binary search is faster than linear search.In case of binary search, 
array elements must be in ascending order. If you have unsorted array, 
you can sort the array using Arrays.sort(arr) method.The binary search 
algorithm will be automatically performed, and the index at which the 
target was found will be returned or the code will notify that it could 
not find the target.
